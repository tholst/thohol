# About

Yes, every proud website needs an About page. Even the little ones. This is it.

## Who is Thomas

My [linkedIn page](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-holst/) says "Senior Software Developer" - I guess it's hard to deny that there may be some truth in that. :blush: I am currently working at an [innovation group](https://icn.sap.com/) within [SAP](https://www.sap.com/). I am living in Hamburg, Germany.

## What Notes?

Just my personal notes about software development, the Web and Everything. I will *occasionally* (let's be realistic from the start) publish something here. 

I have created this blog with the intention to write more and better about the stuff I am learning and working on. It's like that Gym membership - the *hope* that a subscription will make you exercise regularly. (I know what you are thinking.)

Time will tell...

## This Site

This site is built with React, Webpack, among others. It's a learning project in itself - rest assured, I am ignoring many best practices along the way. I might eventually write down how I built this, until then the repository's [README](https://github.com/tholst/thohol/blob/master/README.md) is your curious mind's best friend.
